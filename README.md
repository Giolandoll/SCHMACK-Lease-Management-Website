# SCHMACK-Lease-Management-Website
The	Global	Lease	Contract	System	is	designed	to	help	companies	manage	and	track	their	
leased	assets,	such	as	cars,	buildings,	offices,	and	land.	The	system	provides	detailed	
information	about	each	lease,	including	contract	duration,	associated	costs,	and	billing	
charges.	End-users,	such	as	cost	center	managers	and	company	representatives,	can	interact	
with	the	system	to	view	and	manage	data	related	to	their	cost	centers.	They	can	make	
adjustments	to	lease	data	such	as	modifying	termination	dates,	updating	cost	information,	
and	adding	new	leased	assets.	Users	can	also	request	to	join	additional	cost	centers	or	
companies	to	access	more	datasets,	with	the	visibility	of	data	controlled	by	a	user	principal	
name	set	up	in	an	Active	Directory	list.	The	system	ensures	that	only	authorized	users	can	
view	or	modify	data	based	on	their	roles	and	assigned	permissions
